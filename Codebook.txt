Original data received from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"

Looking at data files received, following information is extracted

Data has total 28 txt files
Two parts of the dataset - Train and Test/ contain following 6 main files 


#'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
#'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
#'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
#'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
#'train/subject_train.txt': part of the train data 
#'test/subject_train.txt': part of the test data 
 

Another four files README.txt, features_info.txt, features.txt and activity_label.txt contain following information
 

#'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
#'features.txt': List of all features. 
	#lists 561 features of UCI HAR datasets in - 561 obs
	#2 variables (V1: index and V2: features)
	

#'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
	#6 obs of 2 variables V1 and V2
	#Variable V2 - 6 Labels - WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
	
#so 6 activities in activity_labels and 561 features in features 	
	

#Analyse 6 files of two parts of dataset - train and test; 
#train - three text files(xtrain, ytrain and subjecttrain).
#test - three text files(xtest, ytest, subjecttest)
#following information is extracted
	#xtrain	:	7352 obs of 561 variables (each of the 561 obs of features)
	#xtest	:	2947 obs of 561 variables (each of the 561 obs of features)

	#ytrain	:	7352 obs of 1 variable, V1
	#ytest	:	2947 obs of 1 variable , V1

	#subjecttrain:	7352 obs of 1 variable, V1	
	#subjecttest:	2947 obs of 1 variable , V1

#Conclusion : 
	#train data has 7352 obs and test data has 2947 obs
	#x---- files lists obs for 561 features


#Now merge train and test to create one dataset
#merge two x---- files, name merged data frame as Feature as it contains contains 10299 obs (7352+2947) of 561 features
#merge two y---- files, name merged data frame as Activity as it contains 10299 obs (7352+2947) of 1 variable (V1)
#merge two subject---- files, name merged data frame as Subject as it contains 10299 obs (7352+2947) of 1 variable (V1)
#provide appropriate desciptive names to variables such as Activity, Subject and name of features
#Provide appropriate activity names into Activity. At this stage it contains 1,2,3,4,5 or 6
#features.info contains this information 



#Conclusion : Three files for combined (train and test) parts of the datasets are
#	        1. Subject	:contains 10299 obs (7352+2947) of 1 variable Subject
#		2. Activity	:contains 10299 obs (7352+2947) of 1 variable Actitity
#		3. Feature	:contains 10299 obs (7352+2947) of 561 Features


#merge these three data frames name SubjectActivityFeature
#SubjectActivityFeature will have 10299 obs and 563 variables (Subject, Activity, and 561 Features)
#Merge SubjectActivity with Feature for all 10299 obs 
#SubjectActivity = 2 Variables
#Feature = 561 variables
#Total = 563 Variables
#First Subject
#Second = Activity
#from 3-563 are Features

	
#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#mean and std are part of the feature names. there are some features includes "mean" and "std" words
#compate each of the variables (features) with mean() and std() and extract them into measureMean and measureSD


measureMean <- SubjectActivityFeatures[grep("mean()", names(SubjectActivityFeatures), value = FALSE, fixed = TRUE)]
#View(measureMean)
measureSD <- SubjectActivityFeatures[grep("std()", names(SubjectActivityFeatures), value = FALSE, fixed = TRUE)]
#View(measureSD)
