#Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
#This R -Code will download UCI HAR (Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset)
#from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
#This will be an untidy dataset and code will transform it into tidy dataset


# Anaylse data - check how many files are there in this dataset, read appropriate files (*README) for more information

#Analyse 6 files of two parts of dataset - train and test
#train - three text files(xtrain, ytrain and subjecttrain).
#test - three text files(xtest, ytest, subjecttest)

#Conclusion : 
	#train data has 7352 obs and test data has 2947 obs
	#x---- files lists obs for 561 features

#561 features of x---- files are their variables with names V1,V2,...,V561
#provide descriptive names of features from features.txt to these varibles V1,V2,...,V561

#Now merge train and test to create one dataset
#merge two x---- files, name merged file as Feature as it contains 10299 obs (7352+2947) of 561 features
#change variables names (V1...V561) discriptive names from features.txt
